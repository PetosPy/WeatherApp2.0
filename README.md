# WeatherApp2.0
Weather App with tkinter.
This is one of my projects that I am proud of in my programming journey.
I used tkinter for the Graphical User Interface and my weather data comes from a free weather API from OpenWeatherMap.
It was a challenging project for me  at the current level that I am as a progammer, but the more challenging the more 
it solidifies a lot of concepts in my brain.
